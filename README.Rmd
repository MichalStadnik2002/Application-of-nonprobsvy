In this project I investigated the concepts of `nonprobsvy` library to check how different estimators behave. There is a simulation of a population where weekly time spent on sport activities depends on sex, BMI and age. From this population a non-probability and a probability sample are drawn. Then various estimators provided by `nonprobsvy` library (IPW, MI, DR) are used to estimate average weekly time spent on sport. Finally all estimates were presented on the graph and compared to the true mean.
